Compass Sublime Text 2 Bundle
*Once finished, will include snippets for All Compass Core variables, mixins and functions + tab indexing for mixin and function parameters.*

**This is still a work in progress. Only a little less than half done in fact.**

Some day this will all make sense to others:

Parameter begins with $ = has default Compass variable 

int: integer
int+unit: integer + unit type, ex. 14px, 20%
booleen: true or false

mult_args: ability to add multiple arguments

||&lt;del&gt;: if you do not want the available option, delete this parameter
